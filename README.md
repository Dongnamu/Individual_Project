# A Multi-Target Prototype Exercise Tracker for the Gym Environment
## Introduction
Aim of this project is to propose a new concept of exercise tracking by using an off-the-shelf camera to track individuals, recognise exercises and count repetitions in the gym environment.

## Methods
### Person Identification
Person identification is done by analysing colour histograms. This method showed almost 100% accuracy when only two people are present and wearing clothes that vary widely in colour.
